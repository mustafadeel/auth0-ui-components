# Auth0 Web UI Components

A comprehensive library of reusable UI components and utilities for Auth0 integrations, built with modern web technologies and designed for scalability.

## 📦 Packages Overview

This project uses a **monorepo architecture** with multiple packages located in the `packages/` folder. Each package serves a specific purpose and can be used independently or together:

### `packages/core/`

**@auth0/web-ui-components-core** - The foundational package containing core utilities and services.

**What it provides:**

- 🌐 **Internationalization (i18n)**: Translation functions and utilities for multi-language support
- 🔌 **API Services**: HTTP client utilities with error handling for Auth0 API interactions
- 🔐 **MFA Services**: Multi-factor authentication utilities including enrollment, confirmation, and factor management
- 🛠️ **Shared Types**: TypeScript type definitions used across all packages

### `packages/react/`

**@auth0/web-ui-components-react** - React-specific UI components and hooks for Auth0 integrations.

**What it provides:**

- ⚛️ **React Components**: Pre-built UI components for Auth0 features (MFA management, user profiles, etc.)
- 🎣 **Custom Hooks**: React hooks for Auth0 state management and API interactions
- 🎨 **Styled Components**: Beautiful, accessible components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS
- 🔄 **Providers**: React context providers for Auth0 state management

#### Shadcn local developement

1. Update `registry.json` with your changes.

```bash
pnpm build:shadcn
```

3. Open `docs-site` and serve the registry.

```bash
cd docs-site

pnpm run dev
```

4. Go to your app (you can use the `react-spa-shadcn`) and update the components.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add http://localhost:5173/r/my-account/user-mfa-management.json --overwrite
npx shadcn@latest add http://localhost:5173/r/my-org/org-details-edit.json --overwrite
